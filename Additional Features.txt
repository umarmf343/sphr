Great choice! **Mattertags** and **Dollhouse View** are fantastic features to enhance the user experience in virtual tours. If you're building or customizing your own virtual tour platform (like using **SPHR** or a similar framework), there are several other powerful features you can consider adding to make your tours more engaging, interactive, and informative.
 
Here’s a list of features that could complement **Mattertags** and **Dollhouse View**:
  
### 1. **360° Interactive Navigation**
 
 
- **What it is**: Allow users to seamlessly navigate around the space by clicking or dragging to different points of interest. Users can easily move from room to room or area to area within the 3D space.
 
- **Why add it**: This makes the experience more immersive and user-friendly. It mimics the feeling of physically walking through a space.
 

  
### 2. **Hotspots**
 
 
- **What it is**: Interactive points within the virtual space that, when clicked, trigger specific actions such as displaying more information, opening a URL, or even playing media (e.g., images, videos, or audio).
 
- **Why add it**: Hotspots provide targeted interaction opportunities and can guide users to specific features or details in the space, enhancing engagement.
 

  
### 3. **Floor Plan View**
 
 
- **What it is**: A flat, 2D floor plan that can be overlaid or shown alongside the 3D tour. This feature often includes interactive elements where users can click on different rooms or areas of the floor plan to navigate.
 
- **Why add it**: Floor plans are widely used in real estate and architectural tours. It gives users a quick, simple view of the overall layout of a space and can be integrated with interactive 3D models for seamless navigation.
 

  
### 4. **Virtual Reality (VR) Support**
 
 
- **What it is**: Full integration with VR headsets (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, or Meta Quest) to allow users to experience the tour in full 3D immersion.
 
- **Why add it**: VR support elevates the user experience, making it more lifelike and engaging, especially for real estate or educational environments. It also sets your platform apart by offering cutting-edge technology.
 

  
### 5. **Augmented Reality (AR) Integration**
 
 
- **What it is**: Augmented reality can allow users to overlay virtual elements (such as furniture or other objects) into the real world using their smartphones or AR glasses.
 
- **Why add it**: AR can be a powerful tool for interior design, real estate, and even product demos. For example, users can place virtual furniture into a room during the virtual tour to see how it fits.
 

  
### 6. **Measurement Tools**
 
 
- **What it is**: Allow users to take measurements of spaces within the 3D model (e.g., room dimensions, distances between objects) using interactive tools or by selecting two points in the 3D space.
 
- **Why add it**: This feature is highly useful for real estate, architecture, or interior design applications, giving users the ability to plan layouts or assess space sizes directly in the virtual tour.
 

  
### 7. **Audio/Voiceover Support**
 
 
- **What it is**: Add audio commentary or voiceovers to different areas of the virtual tour. This could be a tour guide or an informational narrative.
 
- **Why add it**: This adds a personal touch to the virtual experience and makes it easier for users to understand and engage with the space without needing to read a lot of text.
 

  
### 8. **Multi-User Support (Live Guided Tours)**
 
 
- **What it is**: Allow multiple users to visit the virtual tour at the same time and interact in real-time. You can also add live video/audio chat so users can ask questions or get guided by a tour host.
 
- **Why add it**: This feature is perfect for **virtual events**, **real estate agents**, or **museum tours**, where users can have real-time interactions with others, making the experience more social and dynamic.
 

  
### 9. **Interactive Storytelling**
 
 
- **What it is**: Create a guided experience where users move through the space in a specific order, with automatic transitions and hotspots that lead them to key locations.
 
- **Why add it**: Storytelling enhances engagement by creating a narrative flow within the virtual tour, which is especially useful for educational or promotional purposes.
 

  
### 10. **Analytics and Engagement Metrics**
 
 
- **What it is**: Track how users interact with the tour, including which areas they visit most, how long they stay in each section, and what features they click on (like Mattertags or hotspots).
 
- **Why add it**: Analytics help you understand user behavior and improve the user experience by optimizing the tour based on user preferences.
 

  
### 11. **Time-Lapse or Animation Tours**
 
 
- **What it is**: Offer users a time-lapse version of the space (e.g., a building’s construction process or an event that takes place over time), or create animations that guide users through a space automatically.
 
- **Why add it**: Time-lapse or animated tours are perfect for showing progress (e.g., construction) or providing a cinematic experience that adds a layer of storytelling.
 

  
### 12. **Environment and Lighting Effects**
 
 
- **What it is**: Add dynamic lighting effects (e.g., day-to-night transitions) or environmental changes (e.g., moving clouds, changing weather) to simulate different times of day or different conditions.
 
- **Why add it**: Lighting and environmental effects help users experience a space in more varied and dynamic ways, making the virtual tour more realistic and immersive.
 

  
### 13. **Multi-Language Support**
 
 
- **What it is**: Provide translations or options for users to view the virtual tour in different languages.
 
- **Why add it**: Multi-language support is essential if you're targeting international audiences, making the tour accessible to a broader range of users.
 

  
### 14. **Custom Branding and User Interface**
 
 
- **What it is**: Allow full customization of the virtual tour’s user interface (UI) to align with your branding. This includes logo placement, color schemes, and layout design.
 
- **Why add it**: Custom branding helps ensure the virtual tour aligns with the company’s identity, giving it a professional and cohesive feel.
 

  
### 15. **Exporting Options**
 
 
- **What it is**: Allow users to export virtual tours as 3D models, videos, or other formats to be used on other platforms or for offline use.
 
- **Why add it**: Exporting options are beneficial for users who want to repurpose the content, such as embedding it in presentations or other media.
